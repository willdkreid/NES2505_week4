<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="section-linear-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Linear models</h3>
<p>In the last two weeks, we have been looking at linear models using
<code>lm()</code>. The response data you’ve looked at has been
continuous numerical data, potentially with decimal points.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-data-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Data types</h3>
<p>Your response variable may not always be a continuous numerical one.
In biology you may be dealing with the numbers of birds in a wood (whole
numbers), percentage of crop damage by a pathogen (bounded 0 to 100) or
dead/alive (categorical data). Thinking about your data type allows you
to improve your standard linear model with a “generalised” linear model
that can cope with these types of responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous data</strong>
<ul>
<li>These could be positive or negative, and include decimal points,
2.45, 5.01, -3.78, 2.00. Examples might include temperate (degrees
Centigrade).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Whole number data, bounded by zero</strong>
<ul>
<li>These are often count data, 4, 12, 0, 234. Examples might include
the number of hedgehogs seen at a site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Proportion or percentage data, 0 to 1, or 0 to 100</strong>
<ul>
<li>These values can have decimals, but are bounded between 0 and 1 (or
0 and 100 for percentages). Usually analysed as proportions. 0.23, 0.15,
0.98 etc. Can arise in lots of experiments, e.g. proportion of insects
killed by a new pesticide</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Binary categorical data</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two categories present, often coded as 0 or 1. Again wide occurrence
in biology: dead/alive, present/absent, resistant/susceptible etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-assumptions-of-linear-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Assumptions of linear model</h2>
<p>Linear models assume that our response is a continuous numerical
variable, and the model produces normally-distributed residuals with
homogeneity of variance. Continuous numerical data can take any value,
could be either positive and negative and run from -infinity to
+infinity. Thus our model is of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Response variable} =
\text{Explanatory variable(s)} + Error\)</span></p>
<p>and when your response is a continuous numerical variable then it is
assumed that a histogram of your errors would produce a normal
(Gaussian) or bell-shaped curve.</p>
<div id="section-three-key-types-of-error-distribution"
class="section level3">
<h3>Three key types of error distribution</h3>
<p>When we move from a linear model to using a GLM, we will need to
think about changing the distribution we use or are assuming from our
data. If we undertake a GLM using a Gaussian distribution this is very
similar to just doing a linear model. The reason to switch to a GLM is
because it allows us to work in a generalised framework with other
distributions. The two other distributions you are most likely to need
as biologists are the Poisson distribution for counts named after Simeon
Poisson (French mathematician), and the Binomial distribution for
proportion 1/0 or presence/absence data (no-one seems to have claimed
credit for this one!).</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaussian (normal) distribution: classic bell-shaped curve, used for
<strong>continuous</strong> response</li>
<li>Poisson distribution: <strong>whole number count</strong>
response</li>
<li>Binomial distribution: <strong>proportion</strong> or a
<strong>binary categorical</strong> response</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-generalised-linear-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Generalised linear models</h3>
<p>These are an extension of the standard linear model that you have
already used. They are called with the <code>glm()</code> function, and
can handle Gaussian, Poisson and Binomial error distributions. Before we
look in detail at how <code>glm()</code> work, we will refresh our
memory on the Gaussian (normal) distribution, and introduce the Poisson
and Binomial distributions using interactive controls.</p>
<p>Let’s have a quick look at all three distributions and hopefully this
will become clearer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-normal-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Normal distribution</h2>
<p>This statistical distribution is named after a 19th Century German
mathematician, Friederick Gauss. There are two ‘parameters’ to a normal
distribution, the mean and the standard deviation. Conveniently, 95% of
the data will fall within + or - 1.96 (i.e. approximately 2) standard
deviations.</p>
<p>The interactive tool below will let you change the mean and the
standard deviation so you can see how these two parameters alter the
position along the x-axis and shape of the normal distribution alogn the
x- and y-axes. The blue line represents a fitted curve over the
histogram according to the Gaussian distribution which will help you
visualise the bell-shape.</p>
<h2>The normal (Gaussian) distribution</h2>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Comments</strong> You should have seen the following changes
to the plot when you adjusted the mean and standard deviation:</p>
<ul>
<li>as you increase or decrease the mean, the distribution moves to the
left or the right, but remains roughly the same shape</li>
<li>a low standard deviation results in the values being packed together
while a high standard deviation flattens and spreads the curve</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-poisson-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Poisson distribution</h2>
<p>Often biologists and ecologists collect data in the form of counts
e.g. the number of birds in wood, or number of bacterial colonies on a
Petri dish. These numbers are whole numbers or integers and cannot be
negative values or have decimal points. This means that our distribution
cannot include numbers less than zero. The Poisson distribution allows
us to model count data. It takes a parameter <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (Greek letter lambda) which
adjusts the shape of this distribution. Try mvoing the the interactive
slider left and right to see what happens to the size and shape of the
distribution:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>You should have seen the following things happen to the distribution
when you moved the slider:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is high, you’ll
see that the Poisson distribution looks fairly similar to a normal
distribution, except with whole numbers. However as <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> gets smaller, the distribution
gets <strong><em>squashed</em></strong> to the left, as it cannot have
any values below zero.</li>
<li>The histogram is shown slightly differently, as we are dealing with
whole number counts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-binomial-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Binomial distribution</h2>
<p>There are times when you will collect data that has a binary
response. This could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>dead / alive</li>
<li>present / absent</li>
<li>true / false</li>
<li>proportion or percentage data</li>
</ul>
<p>The main parameter is the probability of “success” on each “trial”.
So if you toss a (fair) coin your probability of a head should be 0.5.
You might do an experiment where you have 25 replicates, in each of
which you try and germinate 10 seeds. The “size” of each replicate is
10, and you would have a count of the numbers of seeds germinated or
failed in each replicate.</p>
<p>Below, we have the simplest setup, 25 replicates, with each of size
one (which produces a very simple plot). Adjust the size of each
replicate, which is equivalent to the number of seeds per replicate in
the example above, and the probability of success, equivalent to the
probability of germination.</p>
<p>In the interactive demonstration below, we have the simplest setup,
25 replicates, with each of size one (which produces a very simple
plot). Before you adjust the sliders, the sample size is only 1
(e.g. one seed per) replicate, and the probability (of germination) is
0.5. Therefore roughly half of your 25 replicates will fall into the 0
(no germination) category, and half into the 1.0 (germination) category.
Adjust the size of each replicate, which is equivalent to the number of
seeds per replicate in this example, and the probability of success,
equivalent to the probability of germination.</p>

<p>You should have observed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you increase the number of seeds per replicate (maximum of 50)
you will see additional whole numbers appearing on the horizontal axis,

<li>the total of all the vertical axes is always 25, which is the total
number of replicates in this example.</li>

<h2>How to generalise</h2>
<div
id="section-how-do-generalised-linear-models-extend-the-standard-linear-model"
class="section level3">
<h3>How do generalised linear models extend the standard linear
model?</h3>
<p>You have already come across the basic syntax for linear models
of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Response = \text{Explanatory
variable(s)} + Error\]</span> where your explanatory variables are
typically treatments, or environmental measures, and your <span
class="math inline">\(Error\)</span> is unknown variation or noise. A
linear model assumes that the <span class="math inline">\(Error\)</span>
is normally distributed. This makes it relatively simple to make a link
from predictions calculated from your explanatory variable(s) to your
response.</p>
<p>Take a simple example, such as a ‘regression’ linear model, where you
have a continuous response variable <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and a continuous explanatory variable
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The form of the model can then
be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = a + b.x + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>Where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> = response variable, measured
on a continuous scale (decimals allowed)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = explanatory variable, in a
regression this is continuous</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> = intercept (where the fitted
regression line crosses the vertical axis)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = gradient of fitted
line</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> = unknown variation or
noise in your data</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create a linear model, the <code>lm()</code> function
estimates the intercept and slope parameters, to predict the response
values as accurately as possible. The above equation is often written
as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x +
\epsilon\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> = intercept</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> = slope</li>
</ul>
<p>This second style of writing has the advantage that it can be
extended to multiple explanatory variables, that might be continuous,
and/or categorical.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_jx_j +
\epsilon\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = the number of explanatory
variables</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> = a counter</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sum\)</span> = Greek letter Epsilon
which indicates to go through each of the next calculations and add the
results together</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_jx_j\)</span> = multiply
parameter. e.g. in the simple regression example we only have two
parameters (<span class="math inline">\(p = 2\)</span>): <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> the intercept (which is multipled
by 1.0) and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> the slope,
which is multiplied by the explanatory variable <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-the-need-for-a-link-function" class="section level3">
<h3>The need for a link function</h3>
<p>I mentioned in passing that we need to make our predictions and link
them back to the explanatory variable. This is straightforward if we
have a normal (Gaussian) distribution, but is complex for Binomial,
Poisson and other distributions. Therefore in a generalised linear model
or GLM, we calculate an <strong>intermediate</strong> value, which is
then “linked” back to the response variable. We call this intermediate
variable <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> (Greek letter eta).
So our equation now becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\eta = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_jx_j +
\epsilon\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-how-to-link-back-to-the-response"
class="section level3">
<h3>How to link back to the response</h3>
<p>How do we then calculate <span class="math display">\[y =
\eta\]</span> There are 3 link functions which we need to know about,
for now, which relate to the 3 distributions we have been through:</p>
<ul>
<li>identity = when we need to use a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
This is used with the linear models we have already discussed earlier in
this course. No transformation needed to convert <span
class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li>log link = when we need to use a Poisson distribution and we have
count data. This uses natural logs rather than logs to base 10 to model
the response variable.</li>
<li>logit link = when we need to use a binomial distribution and our
response variable is binary. This is a little more complex, but R sets
it automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, R’s <code>glm()</code> function automatically picks the
correct transformation for the link function.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-do-i-need-to-worry-about-this" class="section level3">
<h3>Do I need to worry about this?</h3>
<p>On a day-to-day basis, no (which is why I have avoided too many
equations)! But it does have a few impacts that you should be alert to,
that we will discuss as we work through examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Least squares no longer used. The method for estimating the
parameters changes from sums of squares etc. to a technique called
‘maximum likelihood’. Instead of t-statistics for each parameter, you
will see z-statistics displayed.</li>
<li>You will no longer see an R-squared value. Instead, something called
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) will show for each
<code>glm()</code> model. The <strong>lower</strong> the AIC the
better.</li>
<li>Instead of sums of squares (SS) the <code>glm()</code> produces a
<strong>deviance</strong> which can be thought of as a ‘generalised’
SS.</li>
<li>If making predictions for new data based on Poisson or Binomial
errors, you need an extra step to account for the link function.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-the-output-looks-different---why"
class="section level3">
<h3>The output looks different - why?</h3>
<p>When you use <code>glm()</code> rather than <code>lm()</code> you’ll
notice your model <code>summary()</code> is displayed slightly
differently. That is because <code>glm()</code> uses something called
“maximum-likelihood” when estimating parameters. You don’t need to know
the complex mathematics behind this (phew!) but there is a very
accessible description of the basic at <a
href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27290/chapter/196938074">Getting
Started with R: introduction for biologists</a> Chapter 7.</p>

<div id="section-glm-with-count-data" class="section level2">
<h2>GLM with count data</h2>
<div id="section-what-goes-wrong-with-lm" class="section level3">
<h3>What goes wrong with <code>lm()</code>?</h3>
<p>We’ll begin by looking at a simple example of the numbers of species
of aquatic invertebrates in rivers with different levels of pollution.
Aquatic invertebrates can be very sensitive to water pollution, and are
useful <strong>bio-indicators</strong> of pollution events etc.</p>
<p><img src="GLM_files/figure-html/river.jpg" /></p>
<p>An advanced system has now been developed by the Centre for Ecology
and Hydrology that is used by the Envionment Agency to assess river
quality, called
<a href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/rivpacs-reference-database"
target="_blank">RIVPACS</a>. We will, however, just look at a simple set
of species counts and pollution.</p>
<p>The data are in a data.frame called <code>sppcount</code>. Begin by
creating a scatterplot of the data, run a linear model, examine its
summary table, and look at the plots of residuals and QQ plot.
<strong>Hints:</strong> Use <code>gf_point()</code> for the scatterplot,
for the <code>lm()</code> make sure you have your response and
explanatory variables the right way round. Use
<code>mplot(spp_count_lm, which=1:2)</code> to check diagnostic the
residuals and QQ plots with <code>ggplot2</code> graphs or
<code>plot(spp_count_lm, which=1:2</code> for basic graphs.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="sppcount_lm"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>

# Create linear model, check coefficients and R-squared
sppcount_lm &lt;- lm(species~pollution, data=sppcount)
summary(sppcount_lm)

# Display first two diagnostic plots
mplot(sppcount_lm, which=1:2)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>At first site the linear model looks quite good, with a highly
significant negative effect of pollution on the count of species, and
the model explains almost 80% of the variation. However, there are two
clues that something is amiss:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The QQ plot has a distinct S-shape to it</li>
<li>What is the species count at high levels of pollution.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can check the latter by plotting the fitted line onto our
scatterplot, and we can also calculate a predicted number of species for
a given amount of water pollution. As this is a <strong>linear
model</strong> the line function does not do anything, so we can use the
simple <code>predict()</code> function to obtain a predicted spp
count.</p>
<p>In the box below, create a scatterplot with the fitted line, and
check the number of species at a pollution level of about 15. You can
extend the range of your x-axis in your plot by adding the
<code>gf_lim(x = c(0, 15))</code> option.</p>

</div>
<p>We have a problem. From roughly pollution=12.5 onwards we are getting
<strong>negative</strong> numbers of species, which obviously cannot
happen. To solve the problem, we’ll repeat the analysis, but as a
generalised linear model.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-correct-analysis-with-glm-function"
class="section level3">
<h3>Correct analysis with <code>glm()</code> function</h3>
<p>Now let’s analyse these using GLM instead using the correct
distribution and link function. R will automatically pick the correct
transformation for the link function but we will state it explicitly to
help you connect the statistical distribution to the appropriate link
function. You will also see where you would need to state it when
writing the R code. We need to alter slightly what we put into the
model:</p>
<p><code>glm(response ~ explanatory, family = distribution(link ="X"), data =  data_set)</code></p>
<p>You can see an extra term in the model which is <code>family =</code>
that relates to the distribution we will be using and specifies the link
function. Since we are using count data, the correct distribution we

be log. Thinking about the linear model which you just created, simply
replace your original <code>lm()</code> function with <code>glm()</code>

<h3>Writing up the results</h3>
<p>The output from your summary is slightly different from

similar to “There was a significant negative effect of pollution on
species richness (AIC = 163.76, z = -7.165, p &lt; 0.001)”. Several
schema are acceptable for reporting GLMs, but this is probably the most
common.</p>

<div id="section-adding-the-correct-fitted-line" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding the correct fitted line</h3>
<p>You’ll recall that GLMs use <strong>link</strong> functions to
connect the response data to the explanatories, that account for the
appropriate characteristics of the response data. Where the response
data are continuous and <code>lm()</code> can be used, the link function
does not do anything, hence it is known as the “identity”. However, for
Posson (and binomial) distributions, we need to take this into
account.</p>
<p>Poisson (count) distributions use the log-link. We could therefore
take the antilog of our predictions to get back to the values for our
fitted line. Since the <code>glm()</code> uses natural logarithms, often
shown as <span class="math inline">\(ln\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(log_e\)</span>, the antilog is the exponent. Hence
<span class="math inline">\(ln(x)\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span>. R has the function
<code>exp()</code> to take the antilogarithm.</p>
<p>However, this is a little complex to implement, so we are going to
use a slightly easier method, based on the <code>mosaic</code> package.
The <code>mosaic</code> package’s default <code>plotModel()</code>
function will allow you to see the GLM model and original points:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sppcount_glm &lt;- glm(species~pollution, family = &quot;poisson&quot;, data=sppcount)
gf_point(species~pollution, data=sppcount) %&gt;% 
  gf_smooth(method = &quot;glm&quot;, method.args = list(family=&quot;poisson&quot;), se=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="GLM_files/figure-html/glm_plot_v2-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>To see what happens when we extend the x-axis to 15.0 (which you
recall gave <strong>negative</strong> species counts with the
<code>lm()</code> model, we can extend the limits of the x-axis).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gf_point(species~pollution, data=sppcount) %&gt;% 
  gf_lims(x = c(0, 15)) %&gt;% 
  gf_smooth(method=&quot;glm&quot;, method.args = list(family=&quot;poisson&quot;), fullrange=TRUE, se=TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="GLM_files/figure-html/glm_plot_extended-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The above code is a little more complex. We use
<code>gf_smooth()</code> to add the predicted model curve, with
arguments to explain that a GLM with Poisson distribution should be
used. The <code>fullrange=TRUE</code> forces the fitted line to go
beyond the range of the data. This <strong>extrapolation</strong> is
<strong>NOT</strong> normally recommended (you can see the SE bars are
bigger at the ends of the line). However, I have done it here just to
demonstrate that the predicted number of species no longer drops to
unrealistic negative values.</p>

<div

class="section level3">
<h3>Making a prediction for a specific value of water pollution</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to make a prediction of the expected number of
species when the pollution is at 3.64 mg/l. This can be easily done by
creating a <strong>model function</strong> from your <code>glm</code>
using the <code>makeFun()</code> command, and then giving it a
number:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sppcount_glm &lt;- glm(species~pollution, family = &quot;poisson&quot;, data=sppcount)
sppcount_fit &lt;- makeFun(sppcount_glm)
sppcount_fit(pollution = 3.64)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        1 
## 18.73928</code></pre>
<p>Don’t worry that the predicted value includes decimal points; this is
quite acceptable in a GLM. It is how you set it up originally that
matters. If you want, you can calculate the Standard Error (SE) of your
predicted value:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sppcount_glm &lt;- glm(species~pollution, family = &quot;poisson&quot;, data=sppcount)
sppcount_fit &lt;- makeFun(sppcount_glm)
sppcount_fit(pollution = 3.64, se.fit=TRUE)</code></pre>

rising or falling depending on your dataset, rather than a straight
line.</p>

<h3>Visualising the data</h3>
<p>In general, it is useful to quickly visualise the data before you
analyse them. A good summary is a boxplot, but by default that would put
our response variable on the horizontal axis. By default the
<code>gf_boxplot()</code> function expects a continuous variable to the
left of the <code>~</code> sign, and a categorical one on the right.
However, we can rotate the boxplot on its side using the
<code>gf_refine(coord_flip())</code> option.</p>

curve to data of this form:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you have a lot of data, and the points
overlap too much to view clearly, it can be useful to show them as
‘jittered points’ using <code>gf_jitter()</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code># The height option controls how much &#39;jitter&#39; occurs

<p>We can now create the binomial GLM, using the two ‘main effects’ of
<code>calcium</code> and <code>airpoll</code>, and also the interaction
term. Remember that the summary table shows deviance and AIC.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-predicted-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Predicted values</h3>
<p>The coefficient estimates shown in the
<code>summary(lichen_glm2)</code> table are in
<strong><em>logits</em></strong>. Recall the explanation of the
<strong>link</strong> function that is used in GLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaussian (normal) distribution with continuous response = identity
Link = no different from a conventional linear model.</li>
<li>Poisson distribution with count data = log link = take natural
logarithms when analysing by GLM, and exponents, <code>exp()</code>
function, to get back to original units.</li>
<li>Binomial distribution with presence/absence or proportion = take
logits to analyse in the GLM, and ‘anti-logits’ to get back to original
units.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are these mysterious “logits”? Logits are the natural
logarithm of odds, and odds are the ratio of successes to failures (or
presences to absences etc.). Therefore manually calculating your
predicted values is quite complicated, as you have to convert your
estimates back from the original logits. Fortunately (phew!) R will do
this for you automatically, and you can easily view your model
predictions.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>makeFun()</code> command to create a function
from our GLM that can be used to create predictions in the correct units
(a probability between 0 and 1.0) either for a given amount of
<code>calcium</code> and <code>airpoll</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create a prediction function from our best GLM
lichen_fit &lt;- makeFun(lichen_glm2)

# What is the predicted probability of lichen being present at calcium of 2 and
# air pollution of 5?

<div id="section-adding-the-fitted-line" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding the fitted line</h3>
<p>If we want to create a plot with the curve for the predicted
probability across a range of calcium values, we can create a new GLM
that only includes calcium, and make predictions from that. However, for
a simple visualisation, it’s often easier to use
<code>gf_jitter()</code> with <code>gf_smooth()</code> as we did for the

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Key things to remember about generalised linear models, GLMs,
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are an extension of linear models, in that they as well as
continuous response variables, they can handle other responses, such as
count, proportion or binary data.</li>
<li>the error component of a GLM is more flexible as a result, so you
can specify whether Guassian, Poisson or Binomial errors are needed</li>
<li>a slightly different method is used to estimate the model
parameters, namely maximum likelihood rather than least-squares. Thus
the format of the model output may appear slightly different.</li>
<li>you can continue to use conventional diagnostic plots to check that
the assumptions of your model are valid.</li>
